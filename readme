just some stuff for linux on veyron_jerry

I got a poin2 and since chrome is eol on it, went down the rabbit hole of linuxing it.

current setup, u-boot in kern-a on sdcard, because i cant seem to make it work from emmc, loading linux off emmc

current u-boot didnt want to boot, using 2018.07 with patches from https://github.com/atopuzov/c201

kernel is mainline plus patches from https://github.com/SolidHal/PrawnOS (mainly the broken gpt workaround)

plan from here is put u-boot on spi, so i dont have to deal with depthcharge at all.
